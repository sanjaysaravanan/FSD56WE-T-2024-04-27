Recap:

    Why react :
      Virtual DOM
      SPA - Single Page Application

    Setup react project:
    Undetstanding JSX
    Understanding the components
    
  Deploying react to Netlify

  Node_modules: pre-written js codes to be included/imported in a project

  Multi Page App:
    https://retail.onlinesbi.sbi/personal/
    A multiple refresh everytime to download common html codes/assets during interaction.
    which leads lots of request and data consumtption and not being smooth

  Single Page Application:

    one single html with a js integrated, js controls the contents of the page

    SPA, loads only the specific contents which needs changes and makes requests/assets call calls only for the specific region of the site

  React Setup:

    what is react?
      front-end js library for manipulating DOM and producing contents using jsx

    1. npm create vite@latest
    2. enter project name
    3. select framework react
    4. select variant javascript
    5. Follow the instructions on the screen
      1. cd <project-name>
      2. npm install
      3. npm run dev

  Structure of React & Folder Structure

    jsx --> javascript xml, which permitts to write html elements inside js file
      empty fragement --> <></>
      expressions or varaibles can be used in curly {} braces

    import/export

      normal import/export using curly braces/ * as utils

      default import/export

    Virtual DOM:
      Real DOM: Tree like structure 
        html 
          head
            title
            script
            icon
          body
            div
            h1
            a
            p

      Virtual DOM: is In Memory Copy of the real DOM used while manipulating the DOM.

      React  SPA:
      Virtual DOM
        The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.

      Advantage: reconciliation process

        where the changes happens only in the virtual DOM which will be compared with old virtual DOM. And if any difference is found it will affected in the Real DOM. 

        No changes, Only memory/Virtual DOM changes not the real DOM

    webpack & babeljs conversion

    components:
    Components (simple HTML layout to reusable react components)
      Simple function returning JSX syntax combined to form a single component
        Eg:
          Card, Instagram Post, Menu Options
      can be used like a tag/element in jsx syntax
      
      Expressions/variables are put inside curly of jsx syntax
    
    Working with array lists
      List Rendering
      
      Usage of keys:
      key props for a component is used to identify the element uniquely by VDOM
      Do not use array index for key in component that will lead to confusion during interactions

    Conditional rendering:
      Rendering the JSX Elements Conditionally
      {<boolean-value-evaluation> && ( JSX Element )}
      {<boolean-value-evaluation> ? (this JSX Element) : (that JSX Element)}

    Handling Events
      onClick
      onSubmit
      change
    Styling:
      inline style --> using it as object
      HTML Inline
        <img src='https://image.com/image.png' style="height: 200px; width: 100px" />
      React Inline
        <img src={'https://image.com/image.png'} style={{ height: '200px', width: '100px' }} />

      External Styling:
        normal styling using .css

        module styling using .module.css
          import styles from './movie.module.css';
          module styling only classNames and tags are allowed
          Only classNames can be used in module styling
      
      ** Do Not use Document Object in React **

Next Session:
    props:
      attributes passed for a component is called as prop
      which can be used inside the props / destructured at component level

      the essential information needed to create a component for displaying the information

      proptypes:
        specifying the type of the props values needed to create a component
        this helps in reducing unwanted errors because of typeerror    
    
    state
